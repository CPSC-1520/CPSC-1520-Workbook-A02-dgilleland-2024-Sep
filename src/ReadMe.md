# `src` Folder

This **`src`** folder is where you will place practice and demo material for each class.

> :warning: **Do *NOT*** use this repository for any assignments that are worth marks. :warning:

If there is a sample in your instructor's workbook that you want to pull into your own workbook, the easiest way to do that is through a Node package called [**tiged**](https://github.com/tiged/tiged#readme). Here's an example of how to use it to [grab a subdirectory](https://github.com/tiged/tiged#specify-a-subdirectory) from your instructor's workbook:

> ***Note:** The following is based on using the `pnpm dlx` command. If you are using regular node/npm, you should use `npx` instead of `pnpm dlx`.*

```bash
$ pnpm dlx tiged --disable-cache --force DMIT-1234/Instructor-Workbook/src/008/demo-events ./src/008/demo-events
//\____________________________________/ \_______________________________________________/ \___________________/
//      |- Command to run               |- Instructor's source folder (on GitHub)        |- Your local destination folder
```

A more detailed explanation of the command would look like this:

```bash
$ pnpm dlx tiged --disable-cache --force DMIT-1234/Instructor-Workbook/src/008/demo-events ./src/008/demo-events
//\______/ \___/ \_____________/ \_____/ \_______/ \_________________/ \_________________/ \___________________/
// |    |          |          |       |             |                     |                     |- Destination folder
// |    |          |          |       |             |                     |- Instructor's sub-folder
// |    |          |          |       |             |- Name of Instructor's Repo
// |    |          |          |       |- GitHub Organization or User
// |    |          |          |- Force overwrite of existing files
// |    |          |- Disable caching of repo (so you grab the latest version)
// |    |- Command to run
// |- pnpm dlx is a Node package runner (alternative to npx)
```

1. Brief Intro to Developer Tools - A Short Tour *(15-20 min)*
   - Your Browser's **Developer Tools** (F12)
   - Inspecting HTML
   - Source Files
1. JavaScript Environments - *In each environment, declare variables and assign values.*
   - What is a REPL? *Read-Eval-Print Loop*
   - The browser Developer Tools' *Console* tab as a REPL

      ```js
      let answer = 42 // undefined
      answer // 42
      let message = "Hello World!" // undefined
      message // "Hello World!"
      message = answer // 42
      message // 42
      ```

   - Node REPL
     - `.help`
   - JavaScript as a Language: case-sensitive, loosly typed, "interpreted" vs. "compiled" (interpreted languages need an "environment" in which to run while compiled languages have their source code "compiled" into stand-alone executables or libraries)
1. HTML Review and Web Servers
   - Viewing HTML Files in the Browser
   - Why Web Servers?
   - Simple Node Projects
     - Bare-bones project with [Vite]() as a local server
     - Multi-page demo (for paths and the "web root")
   - An aside on file structure
   - An aside on Classless CSS (e.g.: picocss)
   - A note on Standards
     - File Organization
       - üìÇ css
       - üìÇ img
       - üìÇ js
       - index.html
     - Code Style Guide - *You should take note of your instructor's patterns in writing their JavaScript/CSS/HTML code and follow that. It's typically easier to pick up the standards by reviewing your instructor's code as opposed to simply reading a standards document.*
       - For JavaScript, the preferred code style guide to use can be found [here](https://github.com/style-guides/JavaScript?tab=readme-ov-file#guide). Also consider the guidelines used by [MDN for their code samples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Writing_style_guide/Code_style_guide/JavaScript)

     - We can *declare* our own functions
   - Global functions (browser only): `alert()`, `prompt()`, `confirm()`
   - Method vs. Function
     - Global `console` object and `.log()`, `.error()`, `.info()` (browser and node)
     - **Dot notation**: The ever-humble, often-present **Property Accessor** - `.`

   - Exploring via the Browser's Console (Dev Tools)
   - Intellisense in VS Code by using `.` after query-selecting DOM
1. DOM Events and Listeners
   - Different kinds of events:
     - User-initiated events: mouse, keyboard
     - DOM-initiated events: page is loaded, page is navigating away, browser is losing focus or gaining focus (*yes, those annoying ads when you leave/re-enter a page*)
   - Adding Event Listeners
     - You can have multiple listeners for a single event
   - Event bubbling
   - Cancelling default behaviour
     - Stopping navigation of an `<a href>`
   - Functions as variables and "callbacks"
1. Function Callbacks
   - Expecting a function as a parameter

   - Forms and Dialogs
   - :pushpin: *Side Quest* - [How to Create Float Input Label using HTML and CSS](https://youtu.be/QCg7-pVbid8?si=Tq-WmJvC5IZxPLcw) - Excellent for a nice visualization of an input, but also helpful later on for creating a *component* or *module* with those stylistic features.
1. Decisions: Alternate Paths of Logic
   - `if`/`else` statements as "flow-control"
     - "Truthy" and "Falsy" values
     - Simple conditional expressions
     - `&&`, `||` and `!`
   - `if` statements as "validation" (e.g.: *guard clauses* in functions)
     - `typeof` and `instanceof`
     - Other types of validations (in-range)
1. Loops: Repetition
   - Grammar of
     - `while() {}`
     - `do{}while()`
     - `for(init;compare;inc){}`
   - Algorithms:
     - Fibonacci
       - Display the sequence
       - Get a single value
     - Factorial
       - Get the value
     - IsPrime
       - internally it will loop with a counter
         - What's the most efficient way? (`Math.sqrt()` as the stopping point)
       - We can call IsPrime inside a loop to find all the prime numbers up to 500
     - Loop through numbers to find all the "perfect squares" (square root is a whole number) up to 1000
     - Find all the factors of a number
       - Accept a call-back function
         - Display to the console
         - Append to a DOM element's `.innerHTML`
     - IsPerfect - the number is the product and sum of all its factors
       - Do this **without** an array by having two callbacks to the `findFactors()` example above
     -Random Statistics
       - Loop for 100,000 times and a) guess a coin flip then b) flip a coin. Gather the highest stretch of correct guesses
     - **Loop within a loop**
       - Multiplication table as an HTML Table
       - *Prep for **In-Class-5***
1. JavaScript Arrays
   - Declare empty array - `[]` - and initialize array with values
   - `.length` and `.push()` and `.pop()`
   - Arrays of
     - strings
     - numbers
     - "mixed" types
   - `.join()`
   - Manually looping through the array
     - to aggregate (equivalent of `.reduce()`)
     - to search (equivalent of `.find()`)
     -Random Statistics
       - Loop for 100,000 times and a) guess a coin flip then b) flip a coin. Gather an array of the number of correct guesses in a row and the number of incorrect guesses in a row. e.g.: `correct = [832, 75, 16, 18, ...]` where the first index `0` is for `1` correct guess followed by an incorrect guess and index `1` is for `2` correct guesses followed by an incorrect guess, etc.
   - Arrays and indexes; e.g.:
     - direct access
     - use in a traditional `for` loop
     - *for-in* vs. *for-of*
   - Arrays as arguments/parameters to functions
   - Returning Arrays from functions

      // variable names for the resulting values.
      let [first, middle, last] = name.split(" ")
      // You can use the spread operator to grab a "chunk"
      // of values into their own array.
      let [...givenNames, surname] = name.split(" ")
      ```

   - Destructuring Object

      ```js
      let person = {
         fullName: "Stewart Archie Dent",
         suffix: "Jr."
         born: new Date("Feb 29, 2000")
      }
      // When destructuring objects, your variables names
      // must match the property names. If you use a name
      // that doesn't exit on the object, then you get an
      // undefined value.
      let { fullName, suffix, born, age } = person
      ```
