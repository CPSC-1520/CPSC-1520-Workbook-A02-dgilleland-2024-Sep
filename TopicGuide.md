# JavaScript Topics

> This is best viewed using the [Markmap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gera2ld.markmap-vscode) extension in VS Code.

This topical arrangement represents the various ways we can move from topic-to-topic when learning JavaScript. There is no "single path" to covering topics, but there are some basic dependencies. For example, you can't effectively talk about *arrays* until you've discussed *variables*. If you start with *variables*, you can easily do either *flow control* or *functions* as your next topic.

As a recommendation, a "breadth-first" approach to topics is probably more effective than a "depth-first". Having said that, everyone's needs and preferences are likely to differ.
